Hill Climb Racing Controlled by Hand Gestures

Control the Hill Climb Racing game using only your hand gestures and your webcam — no keyboard or mouse needed!

---

How It Works

-  Open Hand → Accelerate (presses Right Arrow key)
-  Fist → Brake (presses Left Arrow key)
-  No hand → No action

Uses your webcam to detect hand poses in real-time with MediaPipe and simulates keyboard presses using PyAutoGUI.


Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- A webcam (USB)
- Game that uses arrow keys (like Hill Climb Racing PC version)
